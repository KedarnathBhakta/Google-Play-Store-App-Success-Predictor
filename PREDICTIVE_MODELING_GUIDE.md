📊 Model Performance

The pipeline trains models for 3 prediction tasks:

1️⃣ Rating Prediction (Regression)
    ⭐ Predicts app ratings (1-5 stars)
    📈 Uses R2 score for evaluation

2️⃣ Success Classification (Binary)
    🟢 Predicts if app will be successful (rating >= 4.0)
    🎯 Uses accuracy for evaluation

3️⃣ Popularity Score (Regression)
    🔥 Predicts combined popularity metric
    📈 Uses R2 score for evaluation

🔍 Model Explainability

🧠 SHAP Explanations
    🌐 Global feature importance
    🧩 Local prediction breakdowns
    🔗 Feature interaction analysis

🧩 LIME Explanations
    🧠 Local interpretable explanations
    📝 Individual prediction reasoning
    💻 Interactive HTML reports

📝 ELI5 Explanations
    🗣️ Human-readable explanations
    📝 Simple language breakdowns
    📊 Feature weight rankings

🌐 API USAGE

Start API Server:
    🚦 python deploy_api.py

Make Predictions:
    📨 import requests
    🌍 url = "http://localhost:5000/predict"
    📱 app_data = {
        "name": "My New App",
        "category": "GAME",
        "type": "Free",
        "size_mb": 50,
        "content_rating": "Everyone",
        "android_version_numeric": 4.4
    }
    📤 response = requests.post(url, json=app_data)
    📬 result = response.json()
    ⭐ print("Rating:", result['predictions']['Rating'])
    🟢 print("Success Probability:", result['predictions']['Rating_Binary'])
    🔥 print("Popularity Score:", result['predictions']['Popularity_Score'])
